# Digit-Recognition
this project of data science is on handwriiten-digit-recogniion.
basically we all have different styles of writing any digits or alphabets. one person's way of writing a digit
differs from any other person's way of writing the same digit. this code basically what it does is it uses mnist
(Modified National Institute of Standards amd Technology) as a base to determine the different digits which is given as an input 
and recognises it and displays the output. the IDE used is "Jupyter Notebook".
